        <h2>Version 1</h2>
			<p>
	            Date: 4/25/2021, I added the framework of this website with there being 3 main sections labeled as, home(index.html), about(about.html), and improvement(improvement.html) 
	            with the main content as of right now being on the home page. This page is going to be the welcome screen as well as where the user can interact with the typing test application.
	            I now relize having the improvement navigation located right next to home makes it look like home Improvement so I will change that in the next version.
	            I plan to have helpful material on the improvement page such as tips on how to be more consistent, how to not look at the keyboard when typing, use of the home row, etc.
	            I also need to figure out how to port my java application into the website.            
			</p>
        <h2>Version 2</h2>
			<p>
				Date 5/9/2021, In this version I have changed the background image, changed main body background color, added css grid to organize the layout of the page,
				I add a figure box to the typing application image, added a semi transparent image, rounded some corners and added gradients to the heading/navigation
				I also messed with some relative and absolute positioning with some elements.
			</p>
		<h2>Version 3</h2>
			<p>
				Date 5/23/2021, In this version I fixed the figure from clipping into the footer as well as hanged the design on mobile screens. If the screen size is under 1100 pixels the formatting will change to block instead of grid and the navigation bar will increase in size.
				I also have added a pull-down menu on the left hand side of the home page. I also added a table with some helpful tips on the resources page.
			</p>
			<h2>Version 4</h2>
			<p>
				Date 6/18/2021, I have spent many days trying to figure out how to embedd my java application on an html based website and have come to the conclusion that a language more suited to live in a web browser would
				be javascript instead of java. Due to this I have instead added a video player showing the demonstration of my WPM app. Other things I have added in this version is an animation for the header and an iframe video 
				that points to the video that inspired me to increase my typing speed in the first place.
