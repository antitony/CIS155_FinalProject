        <h2>Version 1</h2>
       <p>
            Date: 4/25/2021, I added the framework of this website with there being 3 main sections labeled as, home(index.html), about(about.html), and improvement(improvement.html) 
            with the main content as of right now being on the home page. This page is going to be the welcome screen as well as where the user can interact with the typing test application.
            I now relize having the improvement navigation located right next to home makes it look like home Improvement so I will change that in the next version.
            I plan to have helpful material on the improvement page such as tips on how to be more consistent, how to not look at the keyboard when typing, use of the home row, etc.
            I also need to figure out how to port my java application into the website.
